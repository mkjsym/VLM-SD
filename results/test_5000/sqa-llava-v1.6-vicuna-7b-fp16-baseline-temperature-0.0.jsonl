If you're grilling, you would marinate the chicken in a mixture of spices and herbs, then grill it until it's cooked through. If you're baking, you would season the chicken and bake it in the oven until it's cooked through.\n\n4. **Cheese**: The cheese in the image looks like shredded cheddar or a similar type of cheese.

It is evident that the number of marriages has been relatively stable over the years, with a slight increase in the 1980s and a slight decrease in the 1990s. The number of divorces, on the other hand, has shown a significant increase, starting from the 1970s and continuing to rise through the 1980s and 1990s. This suggests that divorce rates have been higher than marriage rates throughout the period.\n\nThe second chart provides a snapshot of the marital status of adult Americans in 1970 and 2000. It shows that the percentage of adults who are never married has increased steadily over the years, from 20% in 1970 to 30% in 2000. In contrast, the percentage of adults who are married has decreased, from 55% in 1970 to 45% in 2000. The percentage of adults who are widowed has also increased, from 10% in 1970 to 15% in 2000.

This indicates that in 1980, natural gas was the primary fuel source for electricity production in Australia, followed by oil, coal, and nuclear power.\n\nIn contrast, the 2000 chart shows a shift in the fuel sources used for electricity production. Natural Gas still holds the largest share (36%), but its proportion has decreased compared to 1980. Oil has increased its share (25%), while Coal has decreased (10%). Nuclear Power has also decreased, accounting for only 5% of electricity production in 2000.\n\nComparing the two charts, we can observe a decrease in the reliance on coal and an increase in the reliance on natural gas and oil. This trend suggests a shift towards cleaner energy sources, as natural gas and oil are generally considered cleaner than coal. The decrease in nuclear power production could be attributed to various factors, such as changes in energy policies, safety concerns, or the availability of other energy sources.\n\nThe comparison between Australia and France reveals that France has a higher proportion of electricity production from Nuclear Power (70%), while Australia has a higher proportion from Natural Gas (50%). This indicates that France has a more nuclear-dependent energy sector, whereas Australia relies more on natural gas.\n\nIn conclusion, the pie charts show a shift in the fuel sources used for electricity production in Australia and France over the period 1980 to 2000.

This could be due to improvements in manufacturing processes, better quality control, or increased production capacity.\n\n2. **Economic Factors**: The cost of producing and discarding plastic might be different, leading to a difference in the amount of plastic produced and discarded. For example, if the cost of producing plastic has decreased, it might be more economical to produce more plastic even if it's discarded.\n\n3. **Consumer Behavior**: The amount of plastic discarded might be influenced by consumer behavior. If consumers are more conscious of the environmental impact of their choices, they might be more likely to recycle or dispose of plastic properly, leading to a decrease in the amount discarded.\n\n4. **Innovation in Plastic Disposal**: There might be innovations in plastic disposal technologies that have led to a decrease in the amount discarded. For example, better recycling processes or the development of biodegradable plastics that break down more quickly in the environment.\n\n5. **Government Policies**: Government policies can also play a role in the difference. Stricter regulations on plastic production and disposal might lead to a decrease in the amount discarded.\n\n6. **Economic Growth**: Economic growth can also influence the difference.
